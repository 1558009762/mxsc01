 * The RAM gets segmented (allocated) as each endpoint gets enabled. This dynamic 
 * allocation FIFO sizes gives flexibility, and does not require that an 
 * endpoint's size be fixed at run-time or during compilation. If there's not 
 * enough FIFO RAM as required by a gadget's endpoint definitions, then an

 * become exhausted. 
 *
 * The DMA virtual address is used for all descriptor operations. The DMA 
 * physical address is for convenience (setting hardware registers, obtaining 
 * addresses for descriptor chaining, etc.). The DMA descriptors are not 
 * allocated on a per-endpoint basis. These are just pointers into the 
 * large block that was allocated for all endpoints.
